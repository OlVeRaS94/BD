	<p>This node reads and manages the AMS / Sciosense CCS811 airquality sensor</p>
	<h3>Node configuration</h3>
	<p><code>i2cBus</code> defines the Number of i2c-Bus you want to use. Caution: This sensor uses so called clock-stretching. Raspberry PI does not support this. To use this sensor you have to
	reduce baud-rate of i2c Interface to 10.000 bauds. To do so add <code>dtparam=i2c_baudrate=10000</code> in /boot/config.txt. </p>
	</p>Raspberry PI 4 allows to use software defined i2c-Bus. It is said
	that this one supports clock-stretching. If you have other devices needing high speed i2c-Bus this may be an option for you. Of course i2c must be generally enabled in raspi-config or via <code>dtparam=i2c_arm=on</code> in /boot/config.txt</p>
	<p><b><u>Warning</u></b>: Sensor may work without reducing interface baud rate, but it looks like it stopped working all of a sudden. So please ensure you've reduced baud-rate.</p>
<p> CCS811 address is either 0x5A or 0x5B. Find out via <code>i2cdetect -y 1</code>. If command can't be found, install via <code>sudo apt-get install i2c-tools</code>. 
	<p> The sensor has 4 measurment modes, quite self-explaining. However mode 4 which provides every 250ms a new measurement only gives you raw data at this rate. According to datasheet only in mode 1-3 TVOC and eCO2 
		are calculated for every sample. At which rate TVOC and eCO2 are calculated at mode 4 isn't described in manual, but I guess every second. It is also not described how to get from raw data to TVOC and eCO2 values. According 
		to manufacturer you have to develop an own algorithm for getting TVOC and eCO2 from raw values, because this algorithm is secret intellectual property.
		See references at the end of document where you can get firmware. Perhaps somebody can reverse-engineer it to get alogrithm...</p>
		<p> When changing mode from higher to lower sample rate sensor should be in idle / off mode for at least 10 minutes. Using a mode with a higher sample rate doesn't require wait time.</p>
		<p> The baseline calibration value should be saved for every mode seperately.</p>
		<p> My recommendation is taking a measurement every 10s or every 60s. This saves energy but gives a reasonable time resolution in measurement.</p>
		<p>Checkbox <code>Disable automatic baseline calibration</code> disables automatic baseline calibration. Even when TVOC goes too high baseline is not adjusted. Values are now just clipped. 
			This setting works only with FW Version 1.x, not in 2.x</p>
		<p> For firmware version 1.x you can change the interval of automatic baseline calibration. Default is 24 hours, but it can be adjusted between every hour and every 1023 hours which are almost 
			43 days. If somebody needs this feature, please open an issue and I'll implement. </p> 
		<p> Firmware version 1.1.0 had a maximum range of 8194 ppm eCO2 and 1187 ppb TVOC. Both values correlated somehow. With firmware version 2.0.1 both values go to 64000 ppb for TVOC and 64000 for eCO2
		according to datasheet. However in my tests with a permanent marker TVOC was maximum at 29206 ppb whereas eCO2 bounced between 16752 ppm and 27613 ppm. </p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
	<p><code>msg.payload</code> contains the commands you want to send to CCS811-airquality-sensor.</p>
	<p> Use these commands: </p>
	<p><code>getMeasurement</code> Returns the environment data. This command also initializes sensor and sets it into desired mode, if not already.</p> <p>eCO2 and TVOC are quite self-explaining. The other values are just for information and can be interpreted with the datasheet.
	<p><code>getCalibrationBaseline</code> Returns the calibration baseline as Buffer object. Baseline should be saved for each sensor mode individually. During the first 500 hours
	it should be saved every 24 - 48 hours, afterwards every 5 - 7 days. </p>
	<p><code>setCalibrationBaseline</code> in <code>msg.payload</code> together with <code>msg.CalibrationBaseline</code> sets the calibration baseline. According to datasheet this should be done after sensor is already running 
		20 - 30 minutes in desired mode. In my tests it could be already done a few seconds after setting desired mode. However it still takes about 20 minutes until readings are quite accurate. You should check if calibration 
	 baseline is really the one you set. If not it either takes still some time until sensor has heated up completely or air quality differs too much compared to the air quality when saving baseline. Specify Buffer in format like ["0x1f","0xcc"].</p>
	<p><code>getFWVersions</code> Returns the Bootloader firmware version and App firmware version of your CCS811 sensor. In January 2021 version 2.0.1 is the latest firmware. See link in the references section on how to update.</p>
	<p><code>setEnvironmentCalibration</code> Send together with <code>msg.Humidity</code> (relative humidity as number, so 40% gets 40) and <code>msg.Temperature</code> in Â°C to compensate environment changes. In my tests temperature 
	changed resistance of sensor most. Humidity neglible, but for TVOC and eCO2 calculation mechanism humidty is very important. </p>
	<p><code>getErrorRegister</code> Returns the output of error register.</p>
	<p><code>reset</code> Resets the sensor. Useful to circumvent the automatic baseline calibration during 24 hours.
	
	<h3>Additional information</h3>
	<p>Some notes on baseline calibration. As stated in the datasheet there is an automatic baseline correction / calibration with standard interval of 24 hours. This means sensor
		considers the lowest measured TVOC value within 24 hours as 0 TVOC / 400 ppm eCO2. You regularly won't reach thus good air quality. See below.</p>
		<p>This interval can only be programmed or completely disabled on firmware version 1.x. Completely disabling it can be checked in Node properties. 
		If you need adjusting the interval between every hour and every 1023 hours in one hour steps, please open an issue and I'll implement. 
		After you've calibrated with fresh air and noted your baseline I recommend you disabling automatic baseline calibration for indoor usage. 
		Since sensor drifts over time you should regularly re-calibrate it.</p>
		<p> So as workaround for firmware version 2.x I recommend resetting the sensor every 23 hours so reset is before automatic baseline calibration can take place.
			Set the baseline again after initializing / first taken measurement. Since the sensor has already warmed up, there should be no wait time. 
		If you want to have a defined time, reset the sensor every 24 hours. However I doubt internal clock is very accurate so it may happen that automatic baseline calibration took already place.		
		Please remember to calibrate it with really fresh air from time to time.</p>
		<p>Baseline is also automatically calibrated on powerup 
		by setting it to 0 TVOC / 400 ppm eCO2. So if you power up in bad air quality then you get completely wrong readings. Thats why you should calibrate it with fresh air. If you take it outside, please 
		also calibrate environment data temperature and humidity. Then store the calibration baseline and re-set it after powering it up indoor. </p>
		<p>As measurements with a CO2 sensor showed it can take
		hours until there is really a CO2 level of 400 ppm. In winter you'll lose a lot of energy. And temperature and humidity drop a lot, so it is recommended to calibrate manually.</p>
		<p>
		There is also an automatic baseline correction when the sensor reaches its maximum dynamic range unless automatic baseline calibration is disabled which is only
		possible on firmware version 1.x. If sensor gets to its maxmium of TVOC of 1187 ppb / 8192 ppm eCO2 (Firmware Version 1.1.0) resp. 64000 ppb TVOC and 64000 ppm eCO2 (but see notes above)
		baseline is adjusted when readings go
		above these maximum values. There is no clipping unless automatic baseline calibration is disabled! This means without having the same calibration baseline you can't compare these values. </p>
		<p>Especially when testing the sensor by holding an open permanent marker
		near the sensor baseline gets shifted within seconds. 
		To get a comparable value you could use sensor resistance as more reliable value regarding TVOC concentration when exceeding dynamic range. The more TVOC in the air the lower the resistance.
		However this value changes over time, see also baseline calibration. Resistance also changes with temperature. So comparing restistance should only be done when you relly have a constant temperature.</p>
		<p>And TVOC and eCO2 values depend not only on sensor resistance (which changes a lot with temperature) but also on humidity and of course temperature. According to datasheet sensor resistance is devided 
		by the baseline. However in my tests values from baseline register didn't have a linear relationship between sensor resistance and TVOC value read from CCS811. So it is not possible 
		to get from raw data to TVOC and eCO2. This algorithm is secret intellectual property, see also the notes for sensor mode 4. </p>
		<p>In most cases dynamic range should be sufficient unless there is a massive amount of TVOC like from a permanent marker or certain household cleaners or benzine. </p>
		<p>If there is any new information about this, node will be updated.
